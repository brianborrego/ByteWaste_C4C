      summary: Food Search
      description: |-
        The parser access point handles text search for foods as well as filters for the foods like presence specific
        nutrient content or exclusion of allergens.

          - Search for a phrase or keyword using NLP to get food entities from it
          - Get basic nutrition facts and ingredients for each food
          - Search for food by given nutrient quantity for 28 nutrients
          - Search for foods within a given brand
          - With the build in food-logging context it allows for requests which do not contain quantity and suggest
               expected quantities for them.
